I believe Mylie Schmidt is the player who is working with the dealer Billy Jones.
My reasoning is that there were 13 instances of loss money for the casino and at ALL 13 Mylie was playing at Billy's table.
They happened at different times spread across 3 different days with different combinations of players as well.
